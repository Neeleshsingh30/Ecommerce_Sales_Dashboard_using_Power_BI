# 📊 Ecommerce Sales Dashboard using Power BI

This project presents an **interactive Ecommerce Sales Dashboard** built using **Power BI** to analyze
sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and product trends.
The dashboard enables stakeholders to make **data-driven business decisions** by visualizing key metrics.

## 📌 Business Problem

E-commerce businesses generate large volumes of transactional data, but raw data alone does not provide insights.
The challenge is to transform this data into **meaningful visual analytics** that answer questions like:

- Which states and categories generate the highest revenue?
- Which products and sub-categories are most profitable?
- How do sales and profits vary over time?
- What payment modes are customers using the most?

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The project uses structured sales data stored in CSV files:

- **Orders.csv** – Order-level information (order date, customer, state, category)
- **Details.csv** – Transaction details (amount, quantity, profit, payment mode)

These datasets were cleaned and modeled inside Power BI.
